# âŒ¨ Custom Keyboard Sounds
- This App plays keyboard sound effects, when you press keyboard keys ðŸ˜³
- The Goal is to not be like [Mechvibes](https://mechvibes.com/). Because it uses more RAM than Apollo 11.
- We try to be lightweight and non intrusive with Sounds.

### NEED HELP!

- [X] Custom Keybinds
- [X] Tray Icon to turn on and off (maybe)
- [X] Disable the sound when holding a button.
- [ ] New Ideas
- [ ] Build Job with all the Flags already setup in the x64 Build Step!
- [ ] Linux and MacOS

If you wanna help here, We would appreciate it, because we are total C++ beginners and I don't wanna speak about the syntax.
